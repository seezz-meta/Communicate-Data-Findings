## Dataset

> The dataset, 2017-fordgobike-tripdata.csv, is downloaded from [Ford GoBike](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv) 
and licensed by Ford GoBike. This dataset includes 183 421 trips with 16 features such as locations, time, and user attributes.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that the trip's average duration is 11.5 minutes. Most trips are 
taken during the week and in a day mostly taken in the morning and the evening. I found that 
most users lie between the ages 24 and 32 which would maybe mean most bike riders are a working 
class.Most of the users are subscribers, donâ€™t share a trip and gender wise are males.

On a weekday the trip duration averages 11.5 minutes, and 13 minutes in the afternoon. I 
learned that age has a positive correlation with the trip duration as if the older you get the 
longer the trip duration. Customers tend to have longer trips compared to subscribers and males 
have the shortest trip duration.

Females whether they customer or subscriber still have a high trip duration compared to males.



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation I focus on the influence of gender with respect to the number of trips 
taken and the duration of the trip. I focused heavily on categorical data for this presentation.

I first looked at how the gender is distributed in the dataset and learned that males tend to 
take more bike trips compared to females. On the contrary we learned in terms of trip duration 
females take longer compared to male and this could be because of physical strength.
 
I then looked the day of the week were these trips taken and learned most trips are taken during 
the week and that for me shows most trips are taken on weekdays Monday - Friday and have had a huge 
drop on weekends Saturday - Sunday with the lowest trips averaging 14500. Lastly I looked at
the duration of the trips on each day of the week and how that's distributed across the 
different genders. I found that males still have the lowest trip duration during the week with a 11 minutes average 
but spike in weekend with 12 minutes  trip average. Females follow behind the males with a 12 minute trip duration average.
